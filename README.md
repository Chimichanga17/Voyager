# Voyager

This project is a webapp (and thus universally accessible to everyone and every device that has access to the internet, irrespective of differing platform they may be on) for everyone that aims to promote public transport by providing reliable info for a user to reach an unfamiliar destination by providing info on what all buses he should take to reach his destination. The webapp displays route and means the user must take to reach his destination, even if he/she has to take multiple buses to do reach his desired destination.
